v0.6 (Really working towards 1.0)

 - Fixed current spelling mistakes.  Oh my gosh, sorry.  I need to go back to grade school.
 - When Ubuntu/Debian released num-utils in their repositories, they prefixed
   all the programs with 'num', so average because numaverage, bound became numbound and
   so on.  numsum and numgrep already had that, but I thought this was a good idea for
   a few reasons. One being that you can type num<Tab><Tab> and in at least BASH will see
   a list of potential programs.  Helpful to people who either want to know what is available
   or if you forgot what is available.

 - Created numformat with initial options.

 - Added modulo operation to numprocess.

 - Fixed bug in numrange where the prefix and suffix would give a warning if not set.

 - Fixed bug in numprocess that basically prevented power functions from working.  Thanks Jan-Pieter Jacobs.

Fifth Beta Release v0.5

 - Cleaned up a few bits of code in numsum.
 - Adjusted copyright years to 2004.


 Aug. 28th, 2004 06:40 GMT
----------------------------

 - Added -c,-r,-x,-y options to numsum to allow it
 to sum columns and rows and specify which rows and columns you want.

  * Special thanks to the folks on #perl on irc.freenode.org for helping
    me out with the regex for this one.

 - Added -<n> number hack to numsum to quickly specify the column number
  that you want to sum.  For now it only does columns 1 through 9 because
  I need to figure out how to get past Getopt::Std to get the whole number
  specified.  Since this is such a hack, I might just leave it as is or drop it.
